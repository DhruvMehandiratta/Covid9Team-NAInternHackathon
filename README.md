# Covid9Team-NAInternHackathon

This is the readme file for Covid9Team team for the project on theme "Covid".

Problem Statement: - Due to Covid-19 situation, all of us are working from home. Its not very easy to work from home when you have children. Children need attention and care when you are working and are not able to look at them.

To solve this issue, we have built a platform which keeps children engaged in learning and some fun stuff. The platfrom also contains functions like live video streaming through which the students are connected to other students and care takers. Children can also look at learning and fun videos.
It is different and better than the existing websites because it provides a single platform where children and teachers can signup. Teachers can take one on one sessions with children. Teachers and Parents can also meet via the live streaming platform to give feedbacks about the children. It also allows to make match between children. We know that children like to spend time with the ones of their age. So, using our platform, the children get matched to other children via the Playdates feature. Children can also play games and watch recorded videos.

Main functionalies of our product: Live Peer to Peer video streaming, Playdates, Events Signup, Teacher and Parents Signup, Games, recorded learning and fun videos streaming.


Technologies used: HTML, CSS, React.js, IBM Cloud (Cloundant), Google Calendar API, Simple Peer (for peer to peer live streaming via RTC).
